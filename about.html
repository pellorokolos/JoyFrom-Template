					<h1>OUR STORY</h1>
					<p>The JOY ICE CREAM Industry was established as a trading name in the
						year 1970 by Mr. Haris Heletis and Mr. Andreas Moses, secondary
						school teachers. In 1986, the trade name was transformed into a
						limited liability company under the name of JOY ICE CREAM LTD.
						The company has been relocated in the beginning of 2002 to a new
						factory building near the industrial area of ​​Agios Athanasios,
						 while enhancing its productive capacity with new modern machinery
						  and equipment. An important development in the company's
							organizational structure was the staffing and the gradual
							assumption of administrative duties by Mr. Dimi Heletis after
							the completion of his studies.</p>
							 <h1>OUR MISSION</h1>
					<p> JOY holds a very important position in the Cypriot ice cream market.
						 The main focus of the company's operations and
					activities is the production and wholesale trade of a wide variety of
					 ice cream, soft ice cream, frozenyogurt as well as
					 Italian pastes and raw materials for the manufacture
					 of high quality ice cream. The company serves a wide range of clients,
					 some of which include but are not limited to, ice cream shops,
					  ice cream vans, restaurants, cafes, hotels and pastry shops.
